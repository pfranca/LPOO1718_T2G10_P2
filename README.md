## a. Full project source-code, including unit tests.
The project source code is all available in the root of this git rep.
Due to the nature of our game we weren't able to include unit test cases because the only input we use is from the mobile device accelerometer

## b. Platform-specific executable file(s) of the game/app.
Our app runs only on android devices, a single file .apk file can be found in the folder named APK located at the root of this git rep.

## c. Javadoc documentation files.
Javadoc documentation for this project can be found in the folder named JavaDoc located at the root of this git rep.
